# Eulers

This is s series of scripts I developed in order to respond to Eulers site problems.
## Features

- If you see more than one release of a script, last one is the answer
- All scripts have question text as first comment
- Input.txt file is that and we execute it as: ```node SCRIPT.js < input.txt```
- Ouput.txt file exists only if outis too large to manage it and is a result of ```node SCRIPT.js < input.txt > output.txt``` 
- Just few cases I use command line options for a script, will let you know when
